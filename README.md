Apollo is a great dynamic versioned configuration system. scf-apollo gives a bridge from [apollo](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo) to [scf](https://github.com/mydotey/scf).

We can config properties in Apollo management system, but don't care Apollo when we use properties in program. Sometimes we maybe use another configuration management system instead in future.
